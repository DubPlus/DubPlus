## Web Extension info

- :warning: **Don't touch the /Chrome and /Firefox folders** they are autogenerated and are git ignored
- make any changes to the extension in the `/common` folder
- run `npm run ext` to build the Chrome and Firefox folders.


The extensions share the same codebase, it only has slight differences in the manifest.json file. If you need to make browser-specific changes to the manifest file then update in the appropriate file:

`manifest.core.json` - shared manifest items go here    
`manifest.chrome.json` - Chrome-only manfest items go here    
`manifest.firefox.json` - Firefox-only manifest items go here
